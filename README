BUILD
No configuration required
Build with the command: make
Should build with any C++17 compliant compiler
Tested with GCC 7 and 8
This program should work on GNU/Linux systems, hopefully it will also on *BSD systems
Remove temporary files with the command: make clean
Remove all generated files with the command: make mrproper
